The working directory inside the the container is /usr/app
There are some npm installation to run the application.

COMMANDS:
TO LIST DOWN ALL THE IMAGES: docker images
TO LIST DOWN THE CONTAINERS: docker ps
TO BUILD AN IMAGE FROM THE DOCKER FILE: docker build -t <Tag_name>:version <directory of DF> #Ex: docker build -t nodejsappimage .
TO CREATE A CONTAINER OUT OF THE IMAGE: docker run -p <port_to_route_incoming_requests_on_local_host>:<port_inside_container> <image_id>
TO GET INTO THE CONTAINER: docker exec -it <container_id> sh
